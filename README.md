Documentation of the Mantis project

The "mantis" is a ground-based spectral vegetation monitoring system invented by Dr. Heidi Steltzer, of Fort Lewis College, Durango, Colorado. I was the main technical support from 2010 to 2014. This was developed under government research funding, and so is in the public domain. 

This repository contains the sections of the documentation I wrote. These contain usage instructions for two data processing tools, which are other repositories.

 - **mantis-Access**, uses Microsoft Access

 - **NDVI-modules**, uses Python

 These tools also work with Greenlogger data.
